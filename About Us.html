      <p> The founders of Youth Society for Social Service (YSSS) came together while voluenteering for the Youth Initiative Programme organized by Bhutan Cenre for Media and Democracy (BCMD) in 2016.
This programme equipped us with public speaking and debating skills that has helped us grow as individuas in the community. This batch stayed togeter even after the workshop to work for the community.
<p> The first project undertaken by the group was the establishment of Young Writer's Society. This group organized various events to promote writing. It served as a platform for budding wriers of all backgrounds and ages.
  Eventually the group grew from Young Writer's Society to Youth Society for Social Service.
