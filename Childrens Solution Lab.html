<h2> What is Children's Solution Lab about?</h2>
<p>The International Day for the Eradication of poverty (IDEP) is a day for awareness, activism and advocacy, actions against poverty, marked every year on 17th October. The theme of 2020 was "Acting Together To Achieve Social and Environmental Justice For All"</p>
<p>By working towards social and environmental justice, communities have the opportunity to address the underlying root causes of child poverty, at a structural level. It will also enable communities to tackle the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children.
<br>
<p>We worked with a small groups of children to identify issues and propose solutions to those issues.</p>
